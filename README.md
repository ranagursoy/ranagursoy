## Hi there 👋

# Hello, I'm Rana Gürsoy! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am currently pursuing my master's in **Mechatronics Engineering** at Yıldız Technical University. I have a passion for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and their applications in healthcare and sports technology.

## 🔬 Research & Projects
I have worked on various interdisciplinary projects, combining my knowledge of AI, machine learning, and engineering to develop innovative solutions. Some key projects include:

- **Onychomycosis Detection**: Created an AI model using the YOLO algorithm to detect onychomycosis (nail fungus). The model was trained on a carefully curated medical dataset.
- **Tennis Player's Position Detection**: Designed a system using Zed cameras and LSTM models to track tennis players' positions and classify their movements in real time.
- **ECG Signal Classification**: Built an InceptionV3-based model for classifying ECG signals into categories like myocardial infarction and abnormal heartbeats, using transfer learning techniques.
- **Person Tracking System**: Developed a system for tracking individuals in real-time environments using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system can identify and track multiple subjects, and provides valuable data for applications in security and surveillance. Additionally, the tracking process is optimized by giving commands to the camera, allowing adjustments in direction, speed, and zoom to ensure the target is followed accurately and efficiently.
- **Exercise Tracking and User Identification System**: Developed a real-time exercise tracking system using RFID and re-identification technologies. This system is used in gym environments for motion counting and athlete identification, supported by a custom PCB smart wristband and a mobile app.
